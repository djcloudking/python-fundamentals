# List and Tuples in python

## list 

Lists are used when you need a collection of items that can change dynamically, such as elements being added or removed.

Lists are mutable, meaning that you can change their content (add, remove, or modify items).

Lists are defined using square brackets []:
my_list = [1, 2, 3]


## tuples

Tuples are used when you want to ensure the data remains constant throughout the program, such as coordinates, fixed collections, or constants.

Tuples are immutable, meaning that once a tuple is created, its content cannot be changed.

Tuples are defined using parentheses ():
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
