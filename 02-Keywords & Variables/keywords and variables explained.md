# Python keywords and variables explained

By understanding and using keywords and variables properly, you can create clear, efficient, and readable Python programs.


## Keywords

They are special words that tell Python to do specific things, like traffic signs.

Examples:

**if**: This keyword is like saying, "If it's raining, take an umbrella." It checks a condition and decides what to do next.

**for**: Imagine you have a list of chores, and you want to do each one. The for keyword helps you loop through each item.


## Variables

They are custom-labeled containers for storing information, like jars in your kitchen.

***Naming Rules to follow when using variables***:

- Start with a letter or an underscore (_).

- Don't start with a number.
    
- Only use letters, numbers, and underscores.
    
- Always declare variables in lowercase.

- Use underscore if the name is too long like *ci_cd_pipeline* or use camel casing like *CiCdPipeline*.


### Global variables

These are variables declared outside the function or bloc. 

Example:

a = 1
b = 2

def addition
  print (a + b)

addition ()


### Local variables

These are variables declared inside or before the function or bloc. 

Example:

def substraction
  a = 20
  b = 10
  print (a - b)

Substraction ()
